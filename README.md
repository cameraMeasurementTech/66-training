## 📌 Overview

We present Klear-Reasoner, a model with long reasoning capabilities that demonstrates careful deliberation during problem solving, achieving outstanding performance across multiple benchmarks. We investigate two key issues with current clipping mechanisms in RL: Clipping suppresses critical exploration signals and ignores suboptimal trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose **G**radient-**P**reserving clipping **P**olicy **O**ptimization (**GPPO**) that gently backpropagates gradients from clipped tokens.

## 📐 GPPO (Gradient-Preserving Clipping Policy Optimization)

GPPO is a **plug-and-play** replacement for PPO/GRPO that keeps the clipped tokens **in the computational graph** and lets their gradients flow in a **bounded, controlled** way.


### Problem with Vanilla Clipping  
Classic importance-ratio clipping (PPO/GRPO) drops all tokens whose ratio  
$r_t^{(j)}=\pi_\theta/\pi_{\text{old}}$ falls outside $[1-\varepsilon_l,\ 1+\varepsilon_h]$.  
Two side-effects appear:

- **High-entropy exploratory tokens** (large $r$, positive advantage) are killed → less exploration.  
- **Negative trajectories** (small $r$, negative advantage) are ignored → slower correction.


### GPPO

Let  
- $\delta = r_t^{(j)}(\theta)=\pi_\theta/\pi_{\text{old}}$ (importance ratio)  
- $\tilde A^{(j)}$ = group-relative advantage  
- $\text{sg}(\cdot)$ = stop-gradient (detach from back-prop)

The **GPPO objective** is  


![GPPO Loss](https://github.com/suu990901/KlearReasoner/blob/main/docker/CodeCogsEqn.svg)


- **Forward**: behaves exactly like Clip-Higher.  
- **Backward**: the fraction $\frac{1\pm\varepsilon}{\text{sg}(\delta)}$ keeps the clipped magnitude **but still propagates** a mild gradient.


### Gradient Expression  

Let $\phi_\theta(a_{j,t},s_{j,t})$ be the policy-gradient vector.  
The **per-token gradient** is  

![gard](https://github.com/suu990901/KlearReasoner/blob/main/docker/CodeCogsEqn_1.svg)


where  

![condtion](https://github.com/suu990901/KlearReasoner/blob/main/docker/CodeCogsEqn_2.svg)

- **Never zero** → every token contributes to learning.


### General Form with Tunable Scaling ($\beta_1$, $\beta_2$)  

For finer-grained control:  

![general_loss](https://github.com/suu990901/KlearReasoner/blob/main/docker/CodeCogsEqn_3.svg)

Empirically we set $\beta_1 = \beta_2 = 1$.

### Implementation of GPPO
The loss of GPPO only requires modifying **one line of code** based on the PPO/GPPO loss:

*-advantages * torch.clamp(ratio, (1 - cliprange_low) / **ratio.detach() * ratio**, (1 + cliprange_high) / **ratio.detach() * ratio**)*

The complete loss implementation is as follows:

### Using Ray for Multi-Node Training
For multi-node training​​, ensure ​​all nodes are started and connected via Ray​​ before executing the training script. Below is a brief setup guide for Ray across multiple machines:
#### Step 1: Start Ray on the Head Node (node0)

On the first node (typically called `node0`), run:

```bash
ray start --head --dashboard-host=0.0.0.0
```

Get the IP address of the master node.
```bash
MASTER_IP=$(hostname -I | awk '{print $1}')
```
#### Step 2: Connect Other Nodes (e.g., node1)

On each additional worker node (e.g., `node1`), run the following, replacing the IP with that of your head node:

```bash
ray start --address=\"$MASTER_IP:6379\"
```

### RL Training
Run the following script on the master node to start the training task.


```bash
bash recipe/dapo/perf_run_dapo_ours_math.sh # For Math RL
bash recipe/dapo/perf_run_dapo_ours_code.sh # For Code RL
```

In the startup script, you need to set the following variables:
```bash
YOUR_MODEL_PATH="<your_model_path>"
CKPTS_SAVE_DIR="<ckpts_save_path>"
YOUR_TRAIN_FILE="<train_data_path>"
YOUR_TEST_FILE="<test_data_path>"
```

It is worth noting that for training stability, if you train with a sequence length shorter than 32K, we recommend enabling **actor_rollout_ref.actor.overlong_filter=True**, as this filters out samples in the rollout that exceed the maximum sequence length. 

We observed that when training with a 32K sequence length, the model can still optimize stably even with actor_rollout_ref.actor.overlong_filter=False. However, if the maximum sequence length is reduced to 16K, training becomes highly unstable, regardless of whether GPPO or GRPO is used.

### More Exploration
**Our exploration of GPPO is still ongoing, so stay tuned.**
Although we can maintain stability when using native GPPO training on KlearReasoner-8B, we later discovered in other internal business models that if the gradient on the low side of the PPO clip range is too large, it can restrict exploration and lead to entropy collapse. To address this issue, we propose two solutions:

• General Form of GPPO: Reducing the hyperparameter beta1 can decrease the gradient backpropagated from the low side of the clip range. Based on our preliminary experiments, setting beta1 to 0.25 or 0.5 and beta2 to 1 yields good performance. Example script:
```bash
bash recipe/dapo/perf_run_dapo_ours_math_general_gppo.sh # For Math RL
```

• Retaining only the gradient from the high side of the clip range: This approach significantly alleviates entropy collapse and encourages the model to explore. Example script:
```bash
bash recipe/dapo/perf_run_dapo_ours_math_only_high.sh # For Math RL
```


### Evaluation
When we expand the inference budget to 64K and adopt **the YaRN method with a scaling factor of 2.5**. 

The evaluation data for AIME24, AIME25, and HMMT2025 are available in our GitHub repository under the **benchmarks directory**.
For LiveCodeBench, please download the data from the official website.

You can run the following commands to perform inference and evaluation:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/suu990901/KlearReasoner  
cd KlearReasoner/benchmarks  
python inference.py --model "<KlearReasoner-8B_path>" --n 64 --dataset_path ./benchmarks/aime24.qs.jsonl  
python judge_math.py "<path_to_inference_results>"
```
